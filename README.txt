BLOCKCHAIN FOR SECURING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

Abstract:
Driverless cars have the potential to increase safety on the roads by reducing human error. However, this technology can be even further enhanced by the use of the blockchain. In general, blockchain technologies are largely used to ensure secure and immutable transaction records. Typically, these transactions include the exchange of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or the performance of so-called smart contracts (Ethereum). To ensure transaction integrity and non-repudiation, the blockchain provides decentralized storage (also known as a distributed ledger).
The main contribution of this project  is to secure wireless communications for Connected Vehicles.
